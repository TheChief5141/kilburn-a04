    Problem: Construct a program that reads in the following data file
    (you will need to create this data file yourself; name it `exercise42_input.txt`):

    Ling,Mai,55900
    Johnson,Jim,56500
    Jones,Aaron,46000
    Jones,Chris,34500
    Swift,Geoffrey,14200
    Xiong,Fong,65000
    Zarnecki,Sabrina,51500

    Process the records and display the results formatted as a table, evenly spaced, as shown in the example output.

    Pseudocode:
    Create a fileReader variable that will open the file exercise42_input.txt
    Create a scanner variable input that will read the file
    Create a 2-D arrayList that will have space for firstName, lastName, and salary

    run the readInfo method, which will take in the scanner variable and the 2-D arrayList as parameters,
    which will read in from the file and store the info in the arrayList

    run the sortInfo method, which will take in the scanner variable and the 2-D arrayList as parameters,
    which will sort the info based on the order of last names

    run the printInfo method, which will take in the 2-D arrayist as a parameter,
    which will print the sorted info to the user
