public class Solution41 {
    /*Problem:
    Create a program that reads in the following list of names from a file
    called `exercise41_input.txt` and sorts the list alphabetically:

        Ling, Mai
        Johnson, Jim
        Zarnecki, Sabrina
        Jones, Chris
        Jones, Aaron
        Swift, Geoffrey
        Xiong, Fong

        Constraints:
        Don't hard-code the number of names.

        Pseudocode:
        Create a file path that opens exercise41_input.txt and store in a fileReader variable
        Create a bufferedReader variable that will check whether the file has ended or not
        Create a scanner variable input that will read input from the files
        Create an ArrayList that can store the names of the file
        Run the getNames method, which takes in the ArrayList as a parameter
        Create a loop for while the file has not ended,
        store the names in the array
        Run the sortNames method, which takes in the ArrayList as a parameter
        Create a loop for the length of the ArrayList,
        sort the names in the arrayList
        Run the printNames method, which takes in the ArrayList as a parameter
        Create a loop for the length of the ArrayList,
        print the names in the arrayList
